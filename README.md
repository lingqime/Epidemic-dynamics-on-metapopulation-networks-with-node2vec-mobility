The data sets, numerical simulations, and Python codes are all presented in this directory.

The data sets are included in the folder `data set`. The ER random graph, BA model, Random clustered graph, Power-law cluster graph, Geographical threshold graph, LFR model, US airport network, Manizales network are named as `ER-100-6-1.txt`, `BA-100-3-1.txt`, `random clustered graph indpendent 1.txt`, `powerlaw cluster graph p=0.5.txt`, `geographical threshold graph with threshold 80.txt`, `LFR model small mu.txt`, `USAir97-unweighted.txt`, and `colombian.txt`, respectively.
